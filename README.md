My name is Alexander, as a tester, I am trained in the Context-Driven School. That means I focus on honing my skills and understanding the product as a solution provided to a customer. 
I came to testing in a non-traditional way. My background is in running businesses. I ran a restaurant and a spa (at the same time) before the financial crisis hit my home country of Iceland in 2008.

I am active in the testing community. Apart from attending conferences, I presented an experience report at the first Workshop on AI in Testing (WAIT 01).

As part of training my mind, I read philosophy and investigate cold case files.

My work is dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of Testing in real world scenarios. It is my firm belief that limiting the scope of testing solely to software overlooks its broader potential and significance.

The principles and methodologies employed in software testing are, in fact, universally applicable. Any subject, process, or system can be rigorously scrutinized using these techniques. 
In this polarized world with information being thrown at us from all angles, the need for effective testing has never been more critical.
